# mbed-os-dependency-wheel
Mbed-OS Object files dependency wheel

# What it can do
This tool can be used to visualize the dependency between object files. 

## Requirements
Currently this tool works only with builds generated by ARM compiler.

## Installation
Install `arm-none-eabi-gcc` and add to your path. This will install `arm-none-eabi-nm` tool as well.    
The analysis tool require `arm-none-eabi-nm` to be present in your PATH.

Clone this tool to a local directory   
```bash
git clone https://github.com/ARMmbed/mbed-os-dependency-wheel
```
## Running the Analysis   
Once you have generated your build:
* Run the depend.py tool as below.   
   .\depend.py [Path to .map file]
   For example:   
   .\depend.py C:\github\my-test-app\BUILD\k64f\arm\my-test-app.map   
* Open the index.html under your cloned tool directory to see the dependency wheel.

## Interpreting the depedency wheel
In the chart, each object file appears on the periphery of the wheel and if it has outbound or inbound dependency
with any other object files you will be see ribbon lines connecting them to corresponding object files. If an object file
has inbound dependency, meaning if another object is using a symbol exported by this object file, you will see a line
connecting these two objects with wide edge connected to the object exporting the symbol and narrow edge attached to the
caller or the object file using/depending on that symbol. If its an outbound dependency, it would be vice-versa.
